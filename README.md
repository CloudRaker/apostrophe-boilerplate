# Apostrophe Boilerplate v2.x

Apostrophe Boilerplate is a minimal starting point for [Apostrophe 2](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) projects.

To get started, we recommend taking a look at [our guide to creating your first project](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/creating-your-first-project.html). You could also take a look at [Apostrophe's CLI](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) or simply fork this repository.

Once you have a local copy of this project to work from, make sure to install its dependencies with `npm install`. With Apostrophe installed, the first thing to do is bootstrap a fresh database. Run:

```bash
node app.js apostrophe-db:reset
```

To create an admin user account, run the following command (this will prompt you for a password).

```bash
node app.js apostrophe-users:add admin admin
```

Now you're all set! Just run `node app.js` to start up the local server and head to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
