## Version Control

A simple blend of [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

All deployments to the production server should be made from the `master` branch. All development should be pulled from and pushed to the `development` branch. The default branch of this repo has been set to `development` for ease of pull-requesting. Any time the `development` branch is merged into `master`, a corresponding release should be noted in the release tab on Github.
